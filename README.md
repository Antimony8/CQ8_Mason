# Staircase Time Complexity
The time complexity of the code is O(n^2). This is because there are two nested loops. The outer loop runs 'n' times, and the inner loops collectively run a total of n times

# Staircase Space Complexity
The space complexity of the code is O(1). It doesn't use any data structures or recursive calls that would lead to additional space usage proportional to the input size.

# Alternating Characters Recursive Definition
Base Case: If the length of the string s is less than or equal to 1, return 0 (no deletions needed).
Recursive Case: If the first character of the string is the same as the second, return 1 plus the result of the function called with the substring starting from the second character. Otherwise, return the result of the function called with the substring starting from the second character.

# Alternating Characters Time Complexity
The time complexity of the provided code is O(2^n). This is because for each character in the string, the function makes two recursive calls (one with the current character and one without it). The branching factor is 2, and the depth of the recursion is 'n' (the length of the string). As a result, the time complexity is exponential.

# Alternating Characters Space Complexity
he space complexity of the provided code is O(n). This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case, the maximum depth of the call stack is 'n', corresponding to the length of the input string. Each recursive call consumes space on the call stack.
